We are the Brighton PostgreSQL Users Group.
We do advocacy and promote PostgreSQL as database of choice.
Our goal is to let universities, schools and companies to know about PostgreSQL and how they can take advantage of its features.

Please visit her page [https://tonkipappero.deviantart.com/](https://tonkipappero.deviantart.com/) and give her kudos for the amazing work.


## History
The groups started as a meetup in 2015 and over a period of 2 years produced a number of nice talks, all available on [the youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgr5Iv9eJYN2Piy9oYkn6jw).

After a reduction on the general interest the montly meetings are suspended.
The group is currently under reorganisation in order to resume the activities.
