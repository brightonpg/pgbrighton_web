Business intelligence and analytics is the core of any great company and Transferwise is not an exception. 
The talk will start with a brief history on the legacy analytics implemented with MySQL and how we scaled up the performance using PostgreSQL. 
In order to get fresh data from the core MySQL databases in real time we used a modified version of pg_chameleon which also obfuscated the PII data. 
The talk will also cover the challenges and the lesson learned by the developers and analysts when bridging MySQL with PostgreSQL.
