Psycopg is the most used PostgreSQL driver for the Python programming language. 

As a driver it stays at a relatively low level, allowing to use all the features offered by the database. 

Behind the scenes, it does its best to convert the rich Python data model into the likewise rich PostgreSQL data model: we will take a look at the adaptation mechanism and how to customize it to add new data types or change the default behaviour. 

We will also take a look at how psycopg allows Python to tap into the PostgreSQL publish/subscribe mechanism and how this can be used to build reactive and distributed applications.
