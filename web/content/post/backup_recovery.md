Dealing with large databases is always a challenge. The backups and the HA procedures evolve meanwhile the database installation grow up over the time. 
The talk covers the problems solved by the DBA in four years of working with large databases, which size increased from 1.7 TB single cluster, up to 40 TB in a multi shard environment. 
The story tells how was implemented the disaster recovery with pg_dump and the high availability with the log shipping/streaming replication. 
The presentation is based on a real story. 
The names are changed in order to protect the innocents.
