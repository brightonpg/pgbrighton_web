Elastic Search and Postgres: Different ways to search text Postgres provides two special index types for text. 
Searching for records that match a user provided phrase can be done easily and quickly. 
When the speed of these isn't enough then you can use elastic search. 
Elastic search is a very different kind of database that can provide faster and more complex text searches. 
By combining it with postgres you can get the best of both worlds. 
Find out how the different indexing approaches work and how you can get the best of both worlds!
